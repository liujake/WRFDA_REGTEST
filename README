This is the regression testing suite (RTS) for the WRF Data Assimilation system (WRFDA).

1. Contents 

  The contents of the WRFDA regression testing suite are as follows. Some files and directories are required for proper 
  functioning, while others are optional but helpful additions.

Required files and directories:

regtest.pl      The Perl script which runs the regression test suite
testdata.txt    The text file which holds the test information for each platform
WRFDA-data-EM/  The directory containing data used to run each test. Can be a different name as specified in 'testdata.txt'
BASELINE.NEW/   The directory containing baseline comparisons for each test. Can be a different name as specified in 
                'testdata.txt'

Optional files and directories:

scripts/        Contains helpful scripts, such as 'quickcopy.pl' which copies test results to be used as the new baseline.

2. Supported platforms

  This regression testing suite is optimized for use on the NCAR Yellowstone supercomputer. However, with minimal effort it 
  can run (albeit slowly) on personal computers, both Linux and Mac.

  Supported Fortran compilers are ifort, gfortran, and pgf90. Other compilers which should work with minimal effort are xlf 
  and g95.


3. Set up

  In this repository you will find the main testing script and the text files containing test information, but you must 
  download two data sets for the regression testing to function:

    - The test database, containing the necessary files for each test to run
    - The baseline output files for comparison

  These data sets can be found at the WRFDA website: http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfda/regression/index.html 



Usage : regtest.pl --compiler=COMPILER --source=SOURCE_CODE.tar --revision=NNNN --upload=[no]/yes
                              --exec=[no]/yes --debug=[no]/yes --j=NUM_PROCS
        compiler: Compiler name (supported options: xlf, pgi, g95, ifort, gfortran)
        source:   Specify location of source code .tar file (use 'SVN' to retrieve from repository
        revision: Specify code revision to retrieve (only works when '--source=SVN' specified
        upload:   Uploads summary to web
        exec:     Execute only; skips compile, utilizes existing executables

        debug:    Compile with minimal optimization
        j:        Number of processors to use in parallel compile (default 2)
Please note:
A compiler MUST be specified to run this script. Other options are optional.


4. Output

  Most of the messages found in the regression test summary are self-explanatory. Here's a full list of possible outcomes:

  If the test completed successfully:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  match  The output of the test is a bit-for-bit match with the baseline. Excellent news!
  ok     The output of the test is not a bit-for-bit match with the baseline, but the fields are exactly the same. This can 
         result from a change in the variables stored in output, for instance. This is a perfectly acceptable result, but 
         you should update the baseline using the quickcopy.pl script.
  diff   This means that the output of the test is different than the baseline. This often means there is a problem, though 
         if you expect your updates to change the output this may be an acceptable result. Check the output thoroughly!

  If the test failed:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  obsproc failed        For obsproc tests, this status message means that obsproc did not create an observation file.
  Output missing        wrfvar_output was not created. Check the rsl.* files in the test directory.
  Baseline missing      The test could not find a baseline file to compare to your test results.
  Unknown error         Something strange went wrong in the baseline comparison subroutine.
  Mysterious error!     Something strange went wrong (the subroutine for starting the test returned "undef"). 
  diffwrf               diffwrf (used for comparing your output to the baseline) failed for some reason (ensure that it is
     comparison failed  installed on your system and in your $PATH)
  Could not open output Your output or baseline file is malformed (or possibly missing).
     and/or baseline
  fg == wrfvar_output   The test produced output, but the output is equal to the first guess, indicating a problem.
