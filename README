This is the Regression Testing Suite (RTS) for the WRF Data Assimilation system (WRFDA).

0. Purpose

  The purpose of this testing system is to prevent regressions, or the introduction of software bugs, to the WRFDA system. 
  The WRFDA RTS achieves this by running different tests on components of the WRFDA system, the comparing the output to a 
  known baseline. The tests are designed to be customizable, compartmentalized, and easy to create.

                         IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS SYSTEM CAN NOT DETECT INCORRECT RESULTS

  This testing suite can only ensure that all files that should have been created are created, and that the output of the 
  test has not changed since the version which was used to generate the baseline. There are also sanity checks for NaNs in
  the output and cases where the first guess file is equal to the output, but poor assimilation can not be detected.

1. Contents 

  The contents of the WRFDA regression testing suite are as follows. Some files and directories are required for proper 
  functioning, while others are optional but helpful additions.

  Required files and directories:

  regtest.pl      The Perl script which runs the regression test suite
  testdata.txt    The text file which holds the test information for each platform
  WRFDA-data-EM/  The directory containing data used to run each test. Can specify different name in 'testdata.txt'
  BASELINE.NEW/   The directory containing baseline comparisons for each test. Can specify different name in 'testdata.txt'
  wrfda.tar       The WRFDA source code you wish to use. The name can be specified in 'textdata.txt' or the code can be
                  retrieved from a Subversion repository.

  Optional files and directories:

  scripts/        Contains helpful scripts, such as 'quickcopy.pl' which copies test results to be used as the new baseline.

2. Supported platforms

  This regression testing suite is optimized for use on the NCAR Yellowstone supercomputer. However, with minimal effort it 
  can run (albeit slowly) on personal computers, both Linux and Mac.

  Supported Fortran compilers are ifort, gfortran, and pgf90. Other compilers which should work with minimal effort are xlf 
  and g95.


3. Set up

  The WRFDA Regression Testing Suite is kept in the following Subversion code repository (contact Michael Kavulich; 
  kavulich@ucar.edu) for access:

    https://svn-user-kavulich.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/REGTEST/

  In this repository you will find 
    - the main testing script (regtest.pl)
    - a text file containing test information (testdata.txt)
    - a directory containing a few helpful scripts (scripts/)
    - a text file containing data about compile times (compile_baseline.txt)
    - an empty directory which will contain libraries you provide (libs/)
    - this README file

  In addition to the files found in the above repository, you must download two data sets for the regression testing to 
  function:

    - The test database (WRFDA-data-EM), containing the necessary files for each test to run
    - The baseline output files for comparison (BASELINE.NEW)

  These data sets can be found at the WRFDA website: http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfda/regression/index.html

  This system is not yet set up to automatically compile WRFPLUS for 4DVAR tests. Therefore, to run 4DVAR tests, you must
  compile the appropriate code separately. The testing suite will look for the WRFPLUS code in the test's working directory,
  in a sub-directory named 'WRFPLUSV3_compiler', where "compiler" is gnu, intel, pgi, etc.

  Certain tests require external libraries, such as RTTOV and HDF5. You should link/copy the full installation of these 
  libraries into the provided blank 'libs/' directory. These directories should follow the same compiler-specific naming 
  conventions as WRFPLUS; for example, RTTOV compiled with gfortran should be found in the directory 'libs/RTTOV_gfortran', 
  and HDF5 libraries in the directory 'libs/HDF5_gfortran'. These directories should contain the full library installation, 
  so the command `ls libs/HDF5_gfortran` in the above example should show the following subdirectories:

     bin     include lib     share

4. Running WRFDA RTS

  The RTS can be run by executing the main script: 'regtest.pl'

    > ./regtest.pl

  However, without any input arguments, the script will fail with the following helpful message:

A compiler must be specified!

Aborting the script with dignity.

Usage : regtest.pl --compiler=COMPILER --source=SOURCE_CODE.tar --revision=NNNN --upload=[no]/yes --exec=[no]/yes
                   --debug=[no]/yes/super --j=NUM_PROCS --netcdf4=[no]/yes --hdf5=no/[yes] --cloudcv=[no]/yes
                   --testfile=testdata.txt --repo=https://svn-wrf-model.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk

        compiler: Compiler name (supported options: ifort, gfortran, xlf, pgi, g95)
        source:   Specify location of source code .tar file (use 'REPO' to retrieve from repository)
        revision: Specify code revision to retrieve (only works when '--source=REPO' specified)
                  Use any number to specify that revision number; specify 'HEAD' to use the latest revision
        upload:   Uploads summary to web (default is 'yes' iff source==REPO and revision==HEAD)
        exec:     Execute only; skips compile, utilizes existing executables
        debug:    'yes' compiles with minimal optimization; 'super' compiles with debugging options as well
        j:        Number of processors to use in parallel compile (default 4, use 1 for serial compilation)
        cloudcv:  Compile for CLOUD_CV options
        netcdf4:  Compile for NETCDF4 options
        hdf5:     Compile for HDF5 options
        testfile: Name of test data file (default: testdata.txt)
        repo:     Location of code repository

  As should be obvious from the above message, there are a number of command-line options you can provide to the script to 
  run the RTS in different ways. Let's examine these options in detail:

  compiler:
    This is the name of the Fortran compiler you will be using to compile WRFDA. Active testing takes place with gfortran, 
    ifort, and pgf90, but you should be able to easily adapt this test to use any Fortran compiler that WRF is set up for.
    This is the only mandatory command-line argument for regtest.pl
  source:
    This is the source of the code you will be testing. You can enter one of two options:
      --source=REPO will check out a version of the code from the WRF code repository at 
                   https://svn-wrf-model.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/ (or specifies by the "repo" option). By default, the most 
                   recent (HEAD) repository will be checked out, but you can use the "revision" option to change this
      --source=SOURCE_CODE.tar will use a tar file that you specify which contains the WRFDA source code. It must be a tar 
                   file which only contains the WRFDA code in a directory named "WRFDA". You can specify a tar file in a 
                   different directory with either a full path or a relative path.
  revision:
    If you specify "--source=REPO", you can use "--revision=####" to specify a specific revision number to check out of the 
    repository
  repo:
    The default repository when you specify "--source=REPO" is "https://svn-wrf-model.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/". You can specify
    a different repository with this option.
  upload:
    Will upload a summary of the test to the web (found at http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfda/regression/index.html). 
    You must have write permission on the MMM "nebula" machine to successfully use this option, as you will be prompted for 
    your password to upload the summary files
  exec:
    If you have run a previous test and do not wish to delete that code and re-compile, you can use "--exec=yes" to re-run 
    the tests on existing code
  debug:
    Allows you to compile WRFDA without optimization (--debug=yes) or with debug flags and no optimization (--debug=super).
    Results will likely differ from normal files, but these options can help trap errors not caught by the standard tests. 
  j:
    Specify the number of cores to be used with parallel make to speed up compilation. The default is 4, and 16 is the 
    maximum possible value, though values greater than 6 are not recommended, as there is minimal speedup beyond this
  cloudcv:
    Compiles WRFDA with the "CLOUDCV=1" environment variable set, which compiles a lot of if-deffed code for moisture
    control variables that is normally not compiled. There are currently no tests for this option, and it will cause CV3
    tests to dail
  netcdf4:
    Compile for NETCDF4 options.
  hdf5:
    Compile using HDF5 libraries. On by default if the libraries are found in 'libs/HDF5_compiler', but setting this to
    --hdf5=no will disable this option. Required for amsr2 test(s).
  testfile:
    You can read a different test file than the default 'testdata.txt' with this option.

5. Output

  Most of the messages found in the regression test summary are self-explanatory. Here's a full list of possible outcomes:

  If the test completed successfully:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  match  The output of the test is a bit-for-bit match with the baseline. Excellent news!
  ok     The output of the test is not a bit-for-bit match with the baseline, but the fields are exactly the same. This can 
         result from a change in the variables stored in output, for instance. This is a perfectly acceptable result, but 
         you should update the baseline using the quickcopy.pl script. NOTE: Tests using NETCDF4 files will always report 
         'ok' due to limitations of the testing routines that have not yet been resolved.
  diff   This means that the output of the test is different than the baseline. This often means there is a problem, though 
         if you expect your updates to change the output this may be an acceptable result. Check the output thoroughly!

  If the test failed:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  obsproc failed              For obsproc tests, this status message means that obsproc did not create an observation file.
  genbe failed                For gen_be tests, this status message means that gen_be reported failure.
  Output missing              wrfvar_output was not created. Check the rsl.* files in the test directory.
  Baseline missing            The test could not find a baseline file to compare to your test results.
  Unknown error               Something strange went wrong in the baseline comparison subroutine.
  Mysterious error!           Something strange went wrong (the subroutine for starting the test returned "undef"). 
  diffwrf comparison failed   diffwrf (used for comparing your output to the baseline) failed for some reason (ensure that
                              it is installed on your system and in your $PATH)
  Could not open output       Your output or baseline file is malformed (or possibly missing).
            and/or baseline
  fg == wrfvar_output         The test produced output, but the output is equal to the first guess, indicating a problem.
